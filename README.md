# Custom Vesper Theme
Custom minimal theme for vim inspired by Rauno Freiberg's Vesper color scheme for VSCode.
https://github.com/raunofreiberg/vesper

Used https://github.com/VonHeikemen/rubber-themes.vim codebase to build the color scheme. I do not know how to actually properly do this. So this is just for personal use right now.
